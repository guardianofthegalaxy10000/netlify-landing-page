## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd netlify-landing-page/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **View localhost!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!


## üßê Context for the site

A couple thoughts before jumping in

1.  This site was built in a little less than 48 hours.

2.  Directions were to make a landing page for Netlify Analytics, show navigation and paths, set up goals, and suggest potential tests.

3. The goal was to sell Netlify Analytics in a way that feels similar to Netlify.com but target it more for management.

4. Main focus was to explain the product that anyone could understand. The "How-It-Works" aims to complete this goal. 


## üßê What's inside?

1. All styles can be found in **`/styles`**. This was to create a simple way to find styles. I chose to keep Index.scss outside the page folder since its the homepage. 

2. The Image.Js component is used throughout the site to make it easy and simple to use any image in the **`/images`** folder.

3. All pages are stored in the **`/pages`** folder. 

4. All components are stored in the **`/components`** folder. Including the Layout.js which is used on every page. 

5. This site is responsive for all devices. 

6. Due to time constraints, I made the decision not to make the entire site complemented by Netlify CMS. Just the hero section to show I knew how to use the product. 

7. The SEO.js component is a easy way to improve SEO however due to time constraints I was not able to go through and optimized the entire site (ie Img Descriptions).
